    <h1>Ever Had the Desire to Travel to an Island?</h1>
    <h3>I've got the perfect place for you and your family, the <i>Galapagos Islands</i>!</h3>
    
    <h5>Have you ever wanted to travel to an island with beautiful sights of wildlife? The <i>Galapagos Islands</i> are the perfect place not only for you but your family too! There is a total of 21 islands and many fun and exciting activities to do in each one such as snorkeling, hiking, and scubadiving. There are many things to see such as beautiful beaches, giant volcanoes, and especially wild-life centers which are home to some of the rarest species of animals in the world. Did I mention a famous scientist by the name of Charles Darwin visited these islands in 1835 and after visiting the islands it inspired his theory of evolution! When planning this trip the "wet season" is between December and May. This is the best time to visit because although it will be rainy and wet, the water and air temperatures will be warmer and there will be sunny skies and calm seas, as it only lightly rains occasionally.</h5>
    
    <h4>Below is an example of a 1 week vacation to the 7 most visited isands and what you can do in each one going from hiking to visiting the most popular beaches:</h4>

    <h4 class="nofloat">Below are a few reviews on the experiences people had in the Galapagos Islands:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><blockquote>"Amazing and excellent - truly a trip of a lifetime, and one of the few times one can genuinely use the word 'awesome'."</blockquote></li>
        <li><blockquote>"Snorkeling with sea lions and watching three sea lion pups play together on the shore. The wildlife was fantastic and it was amazing to see how inquisitive birds and animals can be without humans feeding them."</blockquote></li>
        <li><blockquote>"I have been on many vacations before and by far this has been the best one yet. I visited during the "wet season", so it wasn't always perfect weather but for the most part it was hot and sunny with blue skies. The sights are beautiful and there are many things to do such as hiking, seeing volcanoes, relaxing on the many beautiful beaches, and seeing all of the amazing wildlife."</blockquote></li>
